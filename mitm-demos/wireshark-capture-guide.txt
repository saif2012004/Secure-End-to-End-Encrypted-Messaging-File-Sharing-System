Wireshark capture tips for the MITM demo
---------------------------------------
Goal: grab only the WebSocket handshake + our JSON frames so the screenshots look clean.

1) Start capture on loopback (Npcap Loopback Adapter) before running the script.
2) Use this display filter for the insecure demo (port 9090):
     tcp.port == 9090 || http.websocket
   For the signed demo swap to port 9091:
     tcp.port == 9091 || http.websocket
3) To highlight our JSON messages, add a contains filter:
     (tcp.port == 9090 || tcp.port == 9091) && frame contains "pubkey"
   (This catches the `{"type":"pubkey"...}` payloads the report talks about.)
4) Right‑click the HTTP 101 Switching Protocols packet → Follow → TCP Stream → save screenshot showing the Upgrade headers.
5) Right‑click any WebSocket data frame → "Show packet bytes" → screenshot the plaintext JSON (works because insecure demo is unsigned).
6) Optional: in the secure demo you can point out that the frame shows a signature + timestamp, but the attack fails (tie it back to the console output).
7) When done, stop capture → File → Export Specified Packets → PCAPNG. Label the file "mitm-demo-capture" for the appendix.

Screenshot checklist
- One shot of the display filter bar with the filter text typed in.
- One shot of the HTTP 101 Upgrade packet detail.
- One shot of a WebSocket frame showing the JSON content.
